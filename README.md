This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# About this project
This project is currently useless for others, just for personal learning.

But I may need a skilled modern web framework, one Angular, Vue or react.
Then I choose React because it seems have better ecosystem than other frameworks.

So I try to combine popular modules surrounding React, to this repository.
If I need some web development demand, I may try this framework.

Main technologies:
- React 16.7
- TypeScript 3.2
- Sass
- React Router 4
- Redux 4
- ReduxSaga
